# Web
Bsc2 - Web Project
This Reository includes the web application I made in the BSc2
This app shows a simple fintness website using PHP.
One thing I want to say here is that before I start this course of server-side web design, I have not touched anything about web programming. This means that I was writing this web and learning HTML, CSS and PHP at the same time. Some kind of code i used referred to the book, PHP and MySql for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual Quick Pro Guide written by Ullman, Larry.
